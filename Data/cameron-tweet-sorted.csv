"derekrootboy","Any Labour MP who abstains to prop up David Cameron as PM has betrayed their mandate. They will be hounded by the voters they conned. #GE15     Labour MPs who vote for or abstains to make David Cameron Prime Minister is a Tory. Constituents should launch petitions for recall. #C4NEWS     Jim Murphy clearly will vote to make David Cameron Prime Minister. Any Labour MPs who does that is a Tory who broke their mandate. #c4news     Chuka Umunna crawl onto #c4news to help David Cameron smear the trade unions and the anti-Tory majority. He's VILE. #VoteCameronOut #VoteSNP     Ed Miliband's team is stuffed fool of traitors who are trying to help David Cameron. Douglas Alexander and Chuka Umanna are two. #c4news     Chuka Umunna's pathetic. Why is he allowed to do ANY interviews? He's shoveling votes into David Cameron's pocket. #c4news #DouglasAlexander     Ed Miliband might be a lunatic but at least he's not David Cameron. That was a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party.     If you include those who don't vote     David Cameron says no votes in a strike ballot must be interpreted his way. I say those who don't vote for him tomorrow vote against him.     Two thirds will vote against David Cameron's Tories     Nick Clegg     Any Labour MP who votes for ANY Tory Queen's Speech or abstains to make David Cameron Prime Minister is a traitor. Votes will HATE them.     David Cameron's coven of millionaire Satanists is endorsed by a so-called free press owned by tax-dodging billionaires. #ANTI_TORY_MAJORITY!     Rich Tories who own mass media tell voters to back David Cameron's govt of millionaires because we are all stupid scum? Yeah     Ed Miliband has blundered into a position where he has told Tories he is surrendering 59 MPs to help David Cameron. Voters think he's mad.     Workers see their overpaid and unpopular bosses who act like bullies tell everyone to help David Cameron? Yeah that'll work. #VoteCameronOut     If I put a question to David Cameron or Douglas Alexander and they blank me     The Lib Dems are extremists. They've propped up David Cameron for the last five years. #scotnight #VoteSNP     Douglas Alexander is vile. He threatens to put David Cameron in office even if the anti-Tory MPs are the majority. #scotnight #VoteSNP #GE15     . @theSNP will fulfill their mandate to topple a Tory government. Douglas Alexander will vote to make David Cameron Prime Minister #scotnight     #scotnight should ask Douglas Alexander if he's the sleazy Front Bencher who is calling on Labour MPs to make David Cameron Prime Minister.     David Cameron     Gordon Brown is a joke. He told us to trust David Cameron's Vow of more powers if we voted NO that he broke when the polls closed. #VoteSNP     The reason @theSNP terrifies Douglas Alexander is because he is up to his eyeballs in protecting the same state rapists as David Cameron.     Douglas Alexander is Ed Miliband's Campaign Manager. He is also working with the #NSA #GCHQ to get David Cameron reelected. #RazorAttack     Who are these members of Ed Miliband's front bench who says an anti-Tory majority must make David Cameron Prime Minister? #DouglasAlexander?     In a few days     Kevin Maguire is not just another Tory just because his attitude towards @theSNP is outrageous. Responding that way helps David Cameron.     If Ed Miliband forms a coalition with David Cameron's Deputy Prime Minister     The Independent is a joke. Boycott that David Cameron toilet paper.     Russell Brand's endorsement is a hammer blow to David Cameron's Tories. Good for him. He also tosses a spanner in the works. #VoteSNP #GE15     I'd definitely register my opposition to David Cameron's govt of millionaires     David Cameron is today a very worried. So is Theresa May. So is Douglas Alexander. Others are too. Glenn Campbell? Paul Hutcheon? #JimOrr?     Douglas Alexander     Douglas Alexander knows he will be investigated by Parliament and by the police for what he has done. If David Cameron wins     Ed Miliband and David Cameron are both massively unpopular. First-past-the-post stops voters testing everyone democratically. #VoteSNP     24) @theSNP mustn't give Ed Miliband ANY excuse to hand power to David Cameron. It looks like he wants this. Why? He's probably just stupid.     14) If David Cameron can't form a government if Ed Miliband votes against     Everything is going @theSNP's way. Unfortunately     Rupert Murdoch has said if David Cameron can't form a majority government     When polls close     Ed Miliband is proof there is no God. If there was what could we have done to deserve him as our only alternative to David Cameron? #GE2015     Two thirds of voters hate David Cameron AND Ed Miliband. Jim Murphy tells us majority to **** off. #leadersdebate #VoteSNP #VoteCameronOut     Jim Murphy defends first-past-the-post. David Cameron and Ed Miliband will have 2/3 voting against them. He doesn't care. #leadersdebate     David Cameron runs a government of millionaires     Douglas Alexander     David Cameron knows he will not be able to be Prime Minister as most MPs will have a mandate to topple him. So he's preparing a coup d'etat.     David Cameron is planning a coup d'etat with less of a democratic mandate than Adolf Hitler won. The left must expose this nasty dictator.     Ed Miliband is the personification of rotten leadership and he is screwing up for the entire left. If David Cameron wins by default? #GE2015     If Ed Miliband hasn't placed a big bet on David Cameron being the next Prime Minister     What David Cameron proposes IS an anti-democratic coup d'etat. The entire left has to accept that. Mass civil disobedience? #VoteCameronOut     If David Cameron can't get his Queen's Speech through Parliament     If Ed Miliband can't draw up a Queen's Speech that can command the majority of the House of Commons     David Cameron is not in control of his MPs any more than Ed Miliband. Each elected to Parliament as individuals     Ed Miliband is NOT in control of his MPs     Comrades from all the parties of the left     . @adowniebrazil @Jordan_859 What @OwenJones84 says here is 100% right. David Cameron is planning a coup d'etat. #VoteCameronOut #VoteSNP     . @OwenJones84 What you say here is right. But Ed Miliband keeps helping David Cameron carry out this coup d'etat. #VoteCameronOut #GE2015     David Cameron and Theresa May are up to their eyeballs in sleazy agent provocateurs. Ed Miliband votes to protect these Special Branch scum.     The left is divided and is going to split each others vote     If Ed Miliband's incompetence leads to a second election or he simply abstains to let David Cameron become Prime Minister     There is no reason why @theSNP should vote for what they have a mandate to oppose. Ed Miliband can't make them. Will he help David Cameron?     Despite everything     Harriet Harman knows only 11% of Scotland thinks Ed Miliband's doing a good job. That's twice as unpopular as David Cameron. #Murnaghan     David Cameron is clueless. Ed Miliband is clueless. Neither is fit to be Prime Minister. Thankfully we don't get to vote for that. #VoteSNP     Yvette Cooper is lying. Ed Miliband is twice as unpopular in Scotland as David Cameron. He has to crawl in and out again. #MarrShow #VoteSNP     Jim Murphy's rats groveled to David Cameron     Jim Murphy's rats can only save themselves by having David Cameron's parasites toss them a lifeboat. People of Scotland: JUST SAY NO! #GE15     David Cameron is going down.So is Theresa May for protecting him after she became aware of his role in #perjury organized in Downing Street.     David Cameron empowers Special Branch state rapists     It's an unelected royal parasite the #CBI bullshit artists at the #BBC can use to distract voters from David Cameron's criminal government     #UDI is not an option. But neither is slavery. Ed Miliband     David Cameron is twice as popular in Scotland as Ed Miliband who has only 11% thinking he is doing a good job. #TragicLittleMan #VoteSNP     Ed Miliband is a sad little man who will only become Prime Minister by default: because David Cameron and his party are even worse. #VoteSNP     The problem is Ed Miliband's behavior invites defense of the victims of his reactionary abuse. And that helps David Cameron. #CatchTwentyTwo     I have no respect for Ed Miliband. I am not going to pretend I do just to get rid of David Cameron. I hate them both. #KickCameronOut #GE15     . @bbclaurak David Cameron is going down. Ed Miliband's incompetence works to his advantage. But I don't think even that will save his bacon.     . @bbclaurak Douglas Alexander's committing crimes to protect David Cameron and Theresa May will be a matter for all MPs. #newsnight #GCHQ     . @bbclaurak David Cameron and Theresa May are out of control. After the election     . @bbclaurak @theSNP's more popular than David Cameron or Ian Katz when it comes to empowering #SpecialBranch pals of Cyril Smith #CSAinquiry     . @bbclaurak David Cameron is being protected by Douglas Alexander because they're both in it together tied to #MI5 and Special Branch. #GE15     . @bbclaurak Ed Miliband is helping David Cameron win by default. I suspect this is not deliberate. His Campaign strategist wants to lose.     . @bbclaurak Ed Miliband     . @bbclaurak Ed Miliband has joined David Cameron     . @bbclaurak David Cameron is turning Scotland into a mass Civil Rights Movement. We shall overcome. Jeremy Corbyn won't let us be crushed.     . @bbclaurak Ed Miliband is as scared of @theSNP as David Cameron is: Scotland's party will dump #DRIP which protects #pedo #MI5. #CSAInquiry     . @bbclaurak David Cameron and Ed Miliband protect Special Branch state rapists and perjurers like Bob Lambert. Theresa May protects them too     . @BBCNewsnight @bbclaurak Jack McConnell is an unelected hasbeen whose 'theory' of democracy is nasty support for David Cameron. #newsnight     Ed Miliband is on course to be as notorious as Ramsay Macdonald. But I doubt David Cameron would reward him with anything. #OutOnHisEar     Labour MPs would lynch Ed Miliband if he abstains on a Tory Queen's Speech. Vote of No Confidence would be topple David Cameron. #VoteSNP     Ed Miliband wants an excuse to let David Cameron become Prime Minister. So rob him of that. Force him to stay in office. Abstain on votes.     If David Cameron loses badly and Ed Miliband does what he threatens     Ed Miliband may simply prove that he really wants David Cameron to be Prime Minister unless he can form a majority government. #VoteSNP     David Cameron     Ed Miliband     Choosing between Ed Miliband or David Cameron as Prime Minister is like asking if you want a dog to chew off your penis or your bollocks.     Do I think Ed Miliband is fit to be Prime Minister. Not for me to say. Is he less so than David Cameron? Actually     Yvette Cooper must know Douglas Alexander protects undercover cops who committed #perjury sanctioned by David Cameron. #bbcaq #FrancesCurran     . @GaryGibbonBlog It won't be @theSNP who would make David Cameron PM. Only Ed Miliband could do that by abstaining on a Tory Queen's Speech.     . @GaryGibbonBlog What Ed Miliband said on #bbcqt is gibberish. It is also anti-Scottish bigotry. He seems to want to prop up David Cameron.     . @sallymag1 If Ed Miliband leads all Labour MPs into the same lobby as @theSNP     . @sallymag1 What Nicola Sturgeon shouldn't have to explain to you is that the ONLY way David Cameron could become PM is if Labour abstain.

Pity that under his Government the national debt has gone through the roof.     I am surprised Nick Clegg has time to tour England in amidst all the back room deals he's doing with David Cameron's team.     David Cameron really doesn't have a clue. If a SpAd told him to privatise food banks     David Cameron proves that people who aren't great academics don't make great politicians either.     After Thursday     I've never understood the 'vote for competence not chaos' argument from Cameron. David Cameron would sell off his Granny at an undervalue.     Constitutional experts have made clear that this is perfectly possible within the law for Ed to become PM     If David Cameron illegally squats in No 10 he should be removed asap     I'm only 40 but David Cameron is by far the worst PM of my lifetime.
