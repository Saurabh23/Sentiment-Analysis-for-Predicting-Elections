a baggage handler from glasgow did more for our 'national security ' than trident you idiot
if you want them so much put them in a tory constituency then
is crosby 's entire strategy `` say nothing about what we 'll do just bad mouth everyone else and hope nobody notices '' ?

it 's not that they want rid of it it 's the positioning of it as there is oil on west coast think about it ? why not in wales
which party is the fairest of them all ? up rate all ex-pat pensions not half of them
it would be betrer to have a lab-cons coalition than snp with either think about it
aircraft carriers with no aircraft russian submarines in scottish lochs lol

one of the main reasons i vote snp trident is a red line
`` : shame you ca n't feed the poor and disabled instead taking their food and giving it to your banker pals '' burn
i thought trident was meant to be secure ? how can people take hostages on there ? that 's pretty irresponsible of you
he 's not got the minerals to face ed
unfortunately m fallon stabbed himself in the back who left us without aircraft carriers ?
leave the boy out of this campaign your `` compassion '' is a lie you took your anger out on the sick and disabled
if youre so confident about trident why wont you on camera eat a nuclear submarine ?
is n't cutting the military budget - like you have been - doing just that though ?
apart from building an aircraft carrier and then discovering that we dont have any planes that can land on it

using michael fallon 's logic i could argue that ca n't be trusted on the nhs because he once left his daughter in the pub
yes a complete moron
the reserve at around % of regulars would be of a similar level to our nato allies thereby..
happy to put people at risk of malnutrition and happy to take away the safety net for the disabled though

it 's not about moving it to england we do n't believe in it at all however if england did want to keep it then..

pls distance yourself from michael fallon 's unfortunate comments
yes because both are on the same level idiot
i would agree with you here prime minister however i also believe a reform of the university process itself
are you kidding after getting myself in worth of debt for no reason i could have done an apprenticeship and got paid
dave has done more to restrict tax dodging in years than labour did in chris
you mean finish your apprenticeship and be lucky if you get work in a call centre just like a degree ?
the apprentice rate will increase by pence to per hour https //www.gov.uk/government/news/new-national-minimum-wage-rates-announced
is n't that figure rather over-optimistic ? a bit like dragon 's den candidates over-stating their est turnover ?
i 'll peg ur level dave
will apprentices end up with of debt as well ?

you wo n't be in the next parliament what right do you have to say what 's best for the uk ?
more promises you can make and fail to keep - just like those made before you were elected
we want apprenticeships to be level-pegging with a university degree to give young people the skills and opportunities they need to succeed
you ca n't count those as they are n't in the *next* parliament are they typical statistics spin

if you want them so much put them in a tory constituency then
is crosby 's entire strategy `` say nothing about what we 'll do just bad mouth everyone else and hope nobody notices '' ?

it 's not that they want rid of it it 's the positioning of it as there is oil on west coast think about it ? why not in wales

he 's not got the minerals to face ed
unfortunately m fallon stabbed himself in the back who left us without aircraft carriers ?
leave the boy out of this campaign your `` compassion '' is a lie you took your anger out on the sick and disabled
if youre so confident about trident why wont you on camera eat a nuclear submarine ?
is n't cutting the military budget - like you have been - doing just that though ?

yes a complete moron
the reserve at around % of regulars would be of a similar level to our nato allies thereby..
happy to put people at risk of malnutrition and happy to take away the safety net for the disabled though

what 's trident got to do with national security ? i 'm more concerned with ur cuts forces instead of toys4 navy
got your polling card in post ?
i do n't want trident but while russia has someone like putin at the helm we need it sad but true they do n't deal in sense
what weed are you smoking what about austerity defence cuts get off the skunk dave
no they are not lib dems hardly in favour of trident desperate stuff from a desperate party edm attack just woeful
but they would do.. pic.twitter.com/dsjrwu3iui
the military top brass have already told us we are defenceless thanks to all the cuts
our security is not at risk by not biilding trident it will not stop isis and co lets get real not a crosbie strong point
what you mean like slashing troop numbers scrapping carriers and using old aircraft so we rate force
love the posturing but [ coughs ] will you commit to % beyond ? http //www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/02/us-army-chief-of-staff-concern-defence-budget
- says the bloke who is slashing the armed forces the police the fire service the prison service
nuclear weapons put the whole planet at risk
you 've already put our security at risk our armed forces are nothing more than a defence for not one to be scared of
- personal attacks on ed miliband do not help advance the case for maintaining the trident deterrent in an unstable world
really ? libya ? ill considered swingeing cuts ? mouthing off about the ukraine ?
you 're as dishonest as your party chair no wonder you never sacked him you 'll do & say anything for power inc a snp pact
getting the % of adult autistics who want to work into work would be more worthwhile
our security nxt ca n't be guarded by
u have done for years falling to tackle the real issue at home more people are killed daily on our streets than trident
thought of returning as pm fills me with dread barely survived past yrs of
aye by spending thousands on an unmoral aswell as illegal weapon while many survive on food banks ? do n't think so cameron
hear hear
spread bankers bonuses to the population billions into the system spent and regenerate the economy
do jog on
no u will cut child benefit but spend on vanity weapons of mass destruction - i am glad u recognise snp can stop trident
on that we can agree meg but has not done his party any favours with savage military cuts
but you have by scrapping nimrod cutting defence budget trident does n't defend our country it 's a reprisal
correct me if i 'm wrong but did n't you go into coalition with a party opposed to renewing trident ?
sir i appreciate what u had tweeted as a head of a great nation..its true anil..india
so you have n't cut the forces then mr cameron ? aircraft carriers troops you have been biggest risk to national security
but you were happy to scrap our only antisubmarine capability

you already have you idiot we ca n't defend ourselves now because of your cuts to our forces.you are a traitor to our country
but you would put the nation at risk.. pic.twitter.com/euu3wjcmr2

so why have you removed all our maritime recon no major surface warships in scot waters and most of army ta ?
and you are holding civilization to ransom with nuclear weapons
says the person reducing our armed forces to dangerously low levels
million barrels of
of course but you 'd just fuck the nation every other way you cunt
no you just put anyone who is n't rich at risk of having a miserable life
untrue so desperate you 'll be out soon
sir i partially agree with that but your party is cutting the armed services to ribbons so slightly hipper critical
you already have with cuts to navy army & air force no air power at sea cuts in front line regiments
you ca n't even lie straight in bed
no a conservative government is too busy screwing the population to think about security
yes well done snp proud
has anyone actually said that or are you making things up again ?
but u r by slashing our armed forces spain could walk in the front door if they wanted
thanks for the share you rock
we need more nukes
nope just the general population as long as you and your cronies are ok
but you have you have reduced our forces to a point where our allies doubt our ability to help and play a role
stop talking bollocks
so true
you really are scraping the barrel here non story
does trident deter is beheadings ? maybe we need a better conventional army these days rather than city levelling weapons

do n't worry dave michael fallon has already got it covered for you
oh such pathetic scaremongering & gutterstooping
britain a needs a conservative government hope your are the next pm
why have you replaced your profile pic with an image of your madame tussauds wax work ?

why not move it to dorset then to appease the scots that do n't want your priapic toys in their backyard ?
sturgeon ca n't be trusted and i thought alex salmond was bad
you 're such a weasel do n't you remember cutting the armed forces ?
a glasgow baggage handler has been more effective than trident
fallon 's comments were a disgrace we expect better
but our healthcare can be sold off to your mates dickhead
you already have by decimating conventional forces
no but you will put our poorest people at risk kindly go be a lollipop man.if anyone will trust you with their kids
no but you 'll let people starve to death on the streets
oh do fuck off and bore another child to death desperate smears you are on your way out mate good riddance

a baggage handler from glasgow did more for our 'national security ' than trident you idiot
if you want them so much put them in a tory constituency then
is crosby 's entire strategy `` say nothing about what we 'll do just bad mouth everyone else and hope nobody notices '' ?

leave the boy out of this campaign your `` compassion '' is a lie you took your anger out on the sick and disabled
if youre so confident about trident why wont you on camera eat a nuclear submarine ?
is n't cutting the military budget - like you have been - doing just that though ?
apart from building an aircraft carrier and then discovering that we dont have any planes that can land on it
how much do you waste on `` national security '' every year you idiot ?

if i vote for you will i get a discount ? pic.twitter.com/bedkxtmwmc
thanks eu you 've increased my costs as a small business thanks to us companies requiring to charge vat
maybe should give up trident for food banks ?
so thats why you 've reduced the armed forces by large numbers and want to scrap nuclear deterrent ? ? ?

no david but what you do is let terrorists in watch home grown free to walk the streets and kill lee rugby tosser
got ta love the classics
it seems you 're in a hole keep digging
hi & saw this
blige bile
hope everyone stands up to over what he has said about nhs workers how dare he walk a day in our shoes
if thinks he is going to win over floating voters by boasting about having nuclear weapons then he is more deranged than ever
do n't look at the carpet i drew something awful on it
really i 'm not so sure
what are you doing about
in to push for control of scottish finances -
a baggage handler from glasgow did more for our 'national security ' than trident you idiot
if you want them so much put them in a tory constituency then
is crosby 's entire strategy `` say nothing about what we 'll do just bad mouth everyone else and hope nobody notices '' ?

it 's not that they want rid of it it 's the positioning of it as there is oil on west coast think about it ? why not in wales
which party is the fairest of them all ? up rate all ex-pat pensions not half of them
it would be betrer to have a lab-cons coalition than snp with either think about it
aircraft carriers with no aircraft russian submarines in scottish lochs lol
( ) goes vegan eats hotdog with cutlery - will the horrors never cease ?
one of the main reasons i vote snp trident is a red line
`` shame you ca n't feed the poor and disabled instead taking their food and giving it to your banker pals '' burn
i thought trident was meant to be secure ? how can people take hostages on there ? that 's pretty irresponsible of you
he 's not got the minerals to face ed
unfortunately m fallon stabbed himself in the back who left us without aircraft carriers ?
leave the boy out of this campaign your `` compassion '' is a lie you took your anger out on the sick and disabled
if youre so confident about trident why wont you on camera eat a nuclear submarine ?
is n't cutting the military budget - like you have been - doing just that though ?
apart from building an aircraft carrier and then discovering that we dont have any planes that can land on it
how much do you waste on `` national security '' every year you idiot ?
although we have many differences there is one quality we all share human spirit familiar ?
how many soldiers do we have ? how many aircraft carriers ?
one of the more important issues that will swing vote away from eats hotdog with knife & fork

pic.twitter.com/bi2tuyfdia
no you 'd just waste billions of pounds we have n't got on something we can never use
the hot dog pic is trending in france pic.twitter.com/ywutliaqtw
one of wealthiest & biggest tory donors is ashcroft ( bearwood corporares )
i 'm pretty sure you have cut all budgets when it comes to defense when will you politicians act professional ?
ha ha after laying off huge amounts of our armed forces you utter knob cheese
the strength of our forces and making them more closely linked to the community
using michael fallon 's logic i could argue that ca n't be trusted on the nhs because he once left his daughter in the pub
yes a complete moron
the reserve at around % of regulars would be of a similar level to our nato allies thereby..
happy to put people at risk of malnutrition and happy to take away the safety net for the disabled though
and getting rid of nuclear weapons is a bad thing ? only in your world
it 's not about moving it to england we do n't believe in it at all however if england did want to keep it then..
- sorry dave this will sending you crying to `` sam cam '' but you 're not liked on twitter did n't see one positive reply
come on twitter let 's find my excellent local an apprentice chef
offensive beyond words for a party that demonises actual unions rt the are the union for parents -
sir pic mobile ~movcamera edit bckground a grt feature abt innovation pl share mytwt
do you think he should follow your lead and capitulate to the scots on the final day ?
the sdsr of under the previous labour govt envisaged fully integrated regular/reserve forces
then you can have trident on the thames with pleasure
fallon talking about 'stabbing in back ' reminded me of how despite having disabled son & father stabbed us all in the back
my dear fellow the whole tory campaign is so hopeless and ineffective i 'm lost for words whose advice are you listening to ?
poor old pic.twitter.com/ivhswoerdc
russian bombers flying around cornwall ?
then how did pensioners have private details leaked from government database 's + we have aircraft carriers with no plains ? ? ?
have you seen the world 's largest oil discovery ever has been made today in the weald ? a key strategic asset for the uk
aye you can shove your weapons of mass destruction up your arse dave
yet you are prepared to hurt the most vulnerable people in our society so much they commit suicide shame on you
johnny depp and all visited cornwall this week looking at buying property in the new hollywood contact our team
heard your coming to the main national grid training centre in eakring feel free to shout out ap broome landscapes
so that 's why you 've cut the armed forces and former military chiefs say we are losing our place on the world stage disarray
goes to show what a joke cameron is if hes only one above a comedian turned political activist )
milliband has already categorically said this is not a debating issue this is a non story and frankly desperate
trident has absolutely nothing to with national security in that respect it is already obsolete plenty money in it though
its a great way into the work place but we have been looking for an apprentice chef for months
oh do n't be so stupid what about you and
all of & fellow compassion is spent on protecting those poor bankers and non-doms

britain is slowly dismantling its military & relying on
more snp members than regulars in the
maybe he will dig up the home guard and i am not joking
never put our national security at risk ? yeah right &
clutching at straws pic.twitter.com/b04xkvxsx0
back stab. ? like our troops coming back with limbs missing etc to be told by atos fit go out and get job
that 's fantastic news
and why the near decimation of the police ?
coz some lowly clerk writes his tweets anyway ( approved my mi5 )
thanks for following when are going to ask about the cdf & his broken promise ? pic.twitter.com/h5qwh5xd9j
so you 'd help labour in any vote to renew trident then i 'm guessing
did n't you vote for the war in iraq ?
trident a red line for lib dems but you 're in coalition with them
national security ? or corporations who make the products profits ?
i 'm pretty sure there is more than one cunt on here you 're not alone
lowest troop numbers since boer war no f35s for another years no nimrod good job dave
invest in the troops training equipment service and after service
ni scot and wales get free tuition and prescription why not england we are in this together
you already have put our country at risk with your defence cuts russian warships going down the channel vs little frigate
whilst i 'm on here i 've not had any tories in wigan this election i 've had more pizza leaflets than political ones why ?
we 're just a military base for the us and they would n't be asking our permission to use their weapons
go ahead do n't worry i can dumb it down for you
hi prime minister i am reliably informed a se england indy ref will be on the agenda following the gatwick oilfield find ?
i think cutting armed forces will do more damage
you sacked over service personnel that 's not risking national security ? idiot
why are there no western ground troops to stop these bastards ? utterly ridiculous
you are the risk
you 've cut armed services to the bone and now your spending billions in order to stir shit in the hope of an election win
outline for us all when you 'd ever use trident ? describe the scenario please
is a statesmen where as ed miliband is just an embarrassment there 's only one real choice for number
how about just run the national debt past us again ? under
real jobs with real hours and a living wage or free tuition to educate themselves pic.twitter.com/87zb0wjx3v
who 's it at risk from ? you bulb faced simpering idiot
aaw do you want to spunk billions on wmd 's dave ? was n't a problem when you cut spending on military though was it ? pathetic
but you did go into coalition with
the thing is our national security would n't be at risk if we would stop dropping bombs on sovereign nations
at risk from who ? north korea ? iran ?
is that a comment you can back with fact or you presuming this will happen ?
years at breaking point for us doctors do not hand out night respite you lied
not like you cut our armed forces massivly or police firefighters ect
`` red lines '' are meaningless political postiuring
new apprenticeships announced today vital that young people have the skills to do well in life & buld on talents
the nuclear deterrence theory has been debunked so many times it 's not worth arguing with you

went the dentist with a blag jsa card to get his filling done on a freebie mac9 confirmed this
carers are at breaking point a week for hours care if we put our kids into residential that 's a week
more scaremongering you got any positive messages ? ? ? no i thought not
how can any1 vote after note they left for you 'i 'm afraid to tell u there is no money kind regards & good luck '
yeah because you 're not cutting troop numbers to the bare bones are you dave ?
desperate wanker you would have conceded by now if you did n't have the media peddling your lies and smears
so why have you made massive cut to our armed forces ? is n't that putting citizens at risk ? hollow words dave
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha through stupid foreign policy decisions eg libya ukraine etc
shove off i do n't need no snake oil
start packing your bags moon face
hold them accountable eh the
unfortunately snp hates you tories more than trident ? and they can do both lab win win hell yes
your campaign is so weak..your letting ed control the daily agenda and all you do is counter..its boring..
it happened in bosnia in between there luckly after years clinton woke up
can you absolutely guarantee that trident keeps 'us ' safe ? can you prove it ?
do you agree with 's inhumane withholding of info about the whereabouts of the
is this how you deal with issues of homelessness once it 's illegal will you say it does n't exist ?
apparently snp now has more members than the entire british armed forces think about that
talking bollocks again dave why are you saying `` labour this labour that ? `` is it cause you 've no ideas of your own ?
sadly that 'self styled ' champion of disabled is refusing to answer questions from disabled
yeh but your riskin our health our finances our independance all for your own gains
it 's the only reason why the whole world has not gone bonkers part & killed each other again in their millions
day why do you want to cut carers benefits ? we care you do n't have a clue
bbc news - 's awkward school photo op
you are not putting anything at risk can you just get rid of it it is socially useless and a complete waste of money

this little girl feels like the rest of us you your only goal is put public funds in private pockets pic.twitter.com/r1qioznrb4
most people do n't want trident replaced and see it as money that would be much better spent elsewhere
is this entire tory campaign based on game theory ?
you do n't even have maritime patrol aircraft to defend the deterrent or find russian boomers
nothing more than a smear you &
this little girl feels like the rest of us you your only goal is put public funds in private pockets pic.twitter.com/zyw2vbra1q
yes because we 've redefined the criteria..oh are n't we splendid it 's ok me & my mates go private poor people smell you know
the elephant in the room during all ur election campaigns mps/lords '
like cutting % of our defence budget while ringfencing foreign aid ?
snp may be against trident but in favour snp not ruled out supporting labour even if trident not scrapped
if
* please remind usgov that shakeraamer welcome in uk call presobama at
why are you attacking disabled children with the cuts ? why dave ?
happy to put its low income ill and disabled inhabitants at risk though dave
do you or support ' s inhumane withholding of info about the whereabouts of the
compared to labours cover ups that 's all you have really ? bravo
you 've been putting our national security at risk for long enough move trident then we do n't want it you can have it
utter bollocks blue tories and red tories would just vote together end of story
bollocks.you already did by allowing the cover up of dangerous and prolific nonces in your govt mi5 are paedo protecters
you put it at risk all the time reduced armed forces refusing to confirm % lock on spending border controls under funded

did n't you say exactly this years ago ?
is n't that libel ? not sure `` parliamentary privilege '' applies once parliament dissolved labour clearly support trident
i think lobbying big business that contributes nothing to society & pulls revenue is more of a threat to national security
did n't you put off renewing trident because the lib dems held you to ransom ?
everyone supports
inconvenience millions re passport checks on leaving to be pc an not profile islamists
of course there 's no problem when you guys vote with pm ed to keep it
are you planning to say anything positive in this campaign or meet anyone who 's not a child animal or tory activist ?
- please may we have a new candidate as david amess is awol somewhere between a knighthood & overseas trips
desperate sad & tragic
no of course you would n't dave just tell the nice people of the uk how much of our armed forces you cut again
david which has caused more damage to the global family central banking or nuclear weapons ? choose
you hold us to ransom on max pension pot size really encourages us to want to save for it
another american tradition besides fixed terms seeking term pm like a president & mud slinging ? left out ? no air force ?
not to mention north staffs the hidden child abuse why lie indeed hypocrisy
watch
no you 'd rather give the cash to your arms dealer buddies and fuck the poor mon the snp
i believe you went into power with an anti trident party
blody forces repress head neck heart badly send waves to my mother nd girls worst case of barbarism spit on u forces
you tried to destroy the uk and created the snp - too late now

shame you do n't take moral leadership on this what would jesus do ?
have no concerns trident will be the least of damage prime ministers edm and n.s do to britain
i maybe mistaken but did n't the last gov't commit to renewing trident but the decision was put on hold in may
thank you david i 'll do just that
please explain how nukes on our doorstep make any of us safe ? if anything scrapping them makes us safer
would also sell all our grandmothers to stay in govt they all would
question to do you support 's inhumane withholding of the whereabouts of the
whats the word for lambskin appron no not templar
so allowing mass immigration is n't causing any security risks ? tell lee rigbys family that
because it 's not really him he 's too busy thinking up cunning plans to make us all suffer
whilst i agree with trident renewal you have unfortunately sunk to the same level as lab & snp on this subject
surely national security is no safer in a century arms race ? did trident prevent the iraq war or destabilisation of libya ?
- dave ?
here is one on trident what would the eu and america think if we got rid of the deterrent ? snp i question

then why did n't you do a head to head debate with rather than bleating about your views on here ? ?
could n't lie straight in bed stick to facts for once what a negative campaign the tories are running
apart from the cuts to the armed forces police & fire service you are a joke & i 'm praying you lose ge2015
we are at risk our armed forces where cut navy raf army budgets reduced we where told we did not need them
oh please let 's put trident miles from where your kids go to school and then see if you 're so happy to keep it
appeasement ? remember what happened during the interbellum
dirty nuke doomsday bomb deterrent put near symbolic aldermaston mad
what 's trident got to do with national security ? i 'm more concerned with ur cuts forces instead of toys4 navy
got your polling card in post ?
i do n't want trident but while russia has someone like putin at the helm we need it sad but true they do n't deal in sense
what weed are you smoking what about austerity defence cuts get off the skunk dave
no they are not lib dems hardly in favour of trident desperate stuff from a desperate party edm attack just woeful
but they would do.. pic.twitter.com/dsjrwu3iui
the military top brass have already told us we are defenceless thanks to all the cuts
our security is not at risk by not biilding trident it will not stop isis and co lets get real not a crosbie strong point
what you mean like slashing troop numbers scrapping carriers and using old aircraft so we rate force
love the posturing but [ coughs ] will you commit to % beyond ?
- says the bloke who is slashing the armed forces the police the fire service the prison service
nuclear weapons put the whole planet at risk
you 've already put our security at risk our armed forces are nothing more than a defence for not one to be scared of
- personal attacks on ed miliband do not help advance the case for maintaining the trident deterrent in an unstable world
really ? libya ? ill considered swingeing cuts ? mouthing off about the ukraine ?
you 're as dishonest as your party chair no wonder you never sacked him you 'll do & say anything for power inc a snp pact
getting the % of adult autistics who want to work into work would be more worthwhile
our security nxt ca n't be guarded by
u have done for years falling to tackle the real issue at home more people are killed daily on our streets than trident
thought of returning as pm fills me with dread barely survived past yrs of
aye by spending thousands on an unmoral aswell as illegal weapon while many survive on food banks ? do n't think so cameron
hear hear
spread bankers bonuses to the population billions into the system spent and regenerate the economy
do jog on
no u will cut child benefit but spend on vanity weapons of mass destruction - i am glad u recognise snp can stop trident
on that we can agree meg but has not done his party any favours with savage military cuts
but you have by scrapping nimrod cutting defence budget trident does n't defend our country it 's a reprisal
correct me if i 'm wrong but did n't you go into coalition with a party opposed to renewing trident ?
sir i appreciate what u had tweeted as a head of a great nation..its true anil..india
so you have n't cut the forces then mr cameron ? aircraft carriers troops you have been biggest risk to national security
but you were happy to scrap our only antisubmarine capability

you already have you idiot we ca n't defend ourselves now because of your cuts to our forces.you are a traitor to our country
but you would put the nation at risk.. pic.twitter.com/euu3wjcmr2
why not just use the old nuclear bombs yo blow up the world with

so why have you removed all our maritime recon no major surface warships in scot waters and most of army ta ?
and you are holding civilization to ransom with nuclear weapons
says the person reducing our armed forces to dangerously low levels
million barrels of
of course but you 'd just fuck the nation every other way you cunt
no you just put anyone who is n't rich at risk of having a miserable life
untrue so desperate you 'll be out soon
sir i partially agree with that but your party is cutting the armed services to ribbons so slightly hipper critical
you already have with cuts to navy army & air force no air power at sea cuts in front line regiments
you ca n't even lie straight in bed
no a conservative government is too busy screwing the population to think about security
yes well done snp proud
has anyone actually said that or are you making things up again ?
but u r by slashing our armed forces spain could walk in the front door if they wanted
thanks for the share you rock
we need more nukes
nope just the general population as long as you and your cronies are ok
but you have you have reduced our forces to a point where our allies doubt our ability to help and play a role
stop talking bollocks
so true
you really are scraping the barrel here non story
does trident deter is beheadings ? maybe we need a better conventional army these days rather than city levelling weapons

do n't worry dave michael fallon has already got it covered for you
oh such pathetic scaremongering & gutterstooping
britain a needs a conservative government hope your are the next pm

sturgeon ca n't be trusted and i thought alex salmond was bad
you 're such a weasel do n't you remember cutting the armed forces ?
a glasgow baggage handler has been more effective than trident
fallon 's comments were a disgrace we expect better
but our healthcare can be sold off to your mates dickhead
you already have by decimating conventional forces
no but you will put our poorest people at risk kindly go be a lollipop man.if anyone will trust you with their kids
no but you 'll let people starve to death on the streets
oh do fuck off and bore another child to death desperate smears you are on your way out mate good riddance
have n't a clue i went to a la school
new oil find in south income must be used for benefit if people so save it for future generations like norway
