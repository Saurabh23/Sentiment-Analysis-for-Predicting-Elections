@lizzjones18 @DrGrumble @David_Cameron Yes. Destroyed our BRITISH VALUES not believing in the community cohesion organised welfare gives :-(
@lizzjones18 @sharpeleven @David_Cameron Any shame yet Cameron or will we hear your sob story about your dead son again? You use it enough

@DrGrumble @lizzjones18 @David_Cameron I think dopey old Dave is in blind panic, #Tory election campaign by Lynton Crosby is a disaster.
@David_Cameron @age_uk This is an excellent idea - charities suffer from a lack of volunteers - women who did this are now paid work.
@David_Cameron @age_uk Who's going to pay for the extra 3 days leave? You?! The companies?I know! TAXPAYERS!! You've got rocks in your head
Is @David_Cameron making up a manifesto as he goes along? Each day he is sounding more and more desperate.

@STshellcast @kopite4everlfc @WOWpetition @David_Cameron I've been fighting for this op for 7 years now.
@David_Cameron @age_uk Ridiculous Dave, paid work whoever pays it is not volunteering. Volunteering is done for FREE. Eton didn't teach you.
@david_cameron @age_uk charater i can;t over looking the minister who wants me to assist in estiblishing their ministry in Australia now.
@stuarthw1 @David_Cameron and history shows how successful sneak attacks against FAR superior forces can easily b successful
@David_Cameron I already do 24 hours a month unpaid volunteering because it's volunteering!! And work full time & run a home.
No you're not. You're forcing employers to give extra leave, hobbling the public sector and the businesses that pay for it. @David_Cameron
@K_Niemietz Of course, there was this from @David_Cameron: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLd9Qutelc … ... but the @Conservatives plan to also run a deficit.
@David_Cameron @age_uk But...wouldn't PAID work be better? Are you making this up as you go along because it sure feels like you are.
@DrGrumble @lizzjones18 @David_Cameron It's the RICH not wanting to have their taxes support the poorest/vulnerable/disabled SHAMEFUL

@Channel4News @Ed_Miliband @NickBolesMP Yes, fear on Tory faces @David_Cameron! Unable to present cogent case, playground bully tactics!
. @AngusMacNeilSNP @David_Cameron So the numerous countries without nuclear weapons are guilty of putting their people at risk?
@David_Cameron, I'd like to invite you to my family home in Basingstoke for a cuppa and a chat. I'd love to learn more about your plans. :)

Funny how @David_Cameron and his cronies want to give us 12 billion of cuts, but want to spend 100 billion on trident missiles. NUT JOBS
@David_Cameron i would say the severe cuts to our military budget and personnel suggests otherwise. #BSBINGO.
. @David_Cameron How come you're planning to reduce military personnel by over 30,000 and the police by 10,000 then, Dave?
Quite ironic @David_Cameron wants to keep Trident as an 'insurance policy',but wont protect Ukraine after Britain signed Budapest Memorandum
@johnnymercer81 @David_Cameron @Conservatives So you would have all listened and cringed to Michael Fallon on @BBCr4today then? :-)

@chunkymark @Ed_Miliband @David_Cameron he's not got the minerals to face ed
@David_Cameron @UKLabour @Independent @LibDems Unfortunately M Fallon stabbed himself in the back. Who left us without aircraft carriers?
@WOWpetition @David_Cameron leave the boy out of this campaign ,your "compassion" is a lie, you took your anger out on the sick and disabled
@David_Cameron If you’re so confident about Trident why won’t you, on camera, eat a nuclear submarine?
@David_Cameron Isn't cutting the military budget - like you have been - doing just that though?
@David_Cameron apart from building an aircraft carrier and then discovering that we dont have any planes that can land on it

@Nettydoors @twychy1 @David_Cameron 3. ..increasing the strength of our Forces and making them more closely linked to the community.
Using Michael Fallon's logic, I could argue that @David_Cameron can't be trusted on the NHS, because he once left his daughter in the pub
@AJohnColes @David_Cameron @AHairyBiker yes a complete moron
@Nettydoors @twychy1 @David_Cameron 2. The Reserve at around 23% of Regulars would be of a similar level to our NATO allies thereby..

@David_Cameron like cutting 10% of our Defence budget while ringfencing Foreign Aid?
@David_Cameron SNP may be against Trident, but @UKLabour in favour. SNP not ruled out supporting Labour even if Trident NOT scrapped #fact
@David_Cameron @JournoStephen if #Trident is about defence, then find a site near Westminster (Thames?) to protect it. Not in the Clyde.
* @David_Cameron: Please remind USGov @WhiteHouse @DeptofDefense @StateDept that ShakerAamer welcome in UK. Call PresObama at 1-202-456-1414

@CameronsCost @joshjk1 @David_Cameron compared to Labours cover ups... That's all you have, really? Bravo!
@David_Cameron you've been putting our national security at risk for long enough. Move trident then, we don't want it. You can have it.
@David_Cameron utter bollocks, blue Tories and red Tories would just vote together, end of story
. @David_Cameron bollocks.you already did by allowing the cover up of dangerous and prolific nonces in your govt. MI5 are paedo protecters
. @David_Cameron You put it at risk all the time. Reduced armed forces. Refusing to confirm 2% lock on spending. Border controls under funded
#CSAPT @David_Cameron does your #CSE plan have #zerotolerance for impunity of higher ranking officials who sexually exploit children?
@David_Cameron didn't you say exactly this 5 years ago?
@David_Cameron Isn't that Libel? Not sure "Parliamentary Privilege" applies once parliament dissolved. Labour clearly support Trident. #fact
@David_Cameron I think lobbying big business that contributes nothing to society & pulls revenue is more of a threat to national security
@David_Cameron well apart from scrapping our aircraft carriers and maritime surveillance capability; and decimating our army
@David_Cameron Didn't you put off renewing Trident because the Lib Dems held you to ransom? #GE2015
@David_Cameron @JournoStephen Everyone supports #Trident should go to Rosyth & personally decommission rusting NUCLEAR subs there, by hand

@David_Cameron - please may we have a new @conservatives candidate as David Amess is AWOL somewhere between a knighthood & overseas trips
@andrewspoooner @David_Cameron Desperate, sad & tragic.
@David_Cameron no of course you wouldn't Dave, just tell the nice people of the UK how much of our armed forces you cut again
@David_Cameron David, which has caused more damage to the Global Family, Central Banking or Nuclear Weapons? Choose #GOVLIKEAJURY
@David_Cameron you hold us to ransom on Max pension pot size! Really encourages us to want to save for it!!!
@David_Cameron another American tradition besides fixed terms, seeking 2 term PM like a President & mud slinging? Left out? No Air force 1?

@David_Cameron @Conservatives Shame you don't take moral leadership on this, what would Jesus do?
@David_Cameron Have no concerns,.as Trident will be the least of damage Prime Ministers EdM and N.S do to Britain .
@David_Cameron I maybe mistaken but didn't the last @UKLabour gov't commit to renewing Trident, but the decision was put on hold in May 2005
@David_Cameron you benefited from being able to debate the incumbent pm in 2010; be a gentleman and afford @Ed_Miliband the same platform
. @David_Cameron Thank you, David. I'll do just that. #ScrapTrident
. @David_Cameron Please explain how nukes on our doorstep make any of us safe? If anything, scrapping them makes us safer.
@wildnflower @David_Cameron would also sell all our grandmothers to stay in Govt, they all would!
@LBC question to @nick_clegg do you support @David_Cameron's inhumane withholding of the whereabouts of the #chibokgirls @BBCAfrica #GE2015
@chunkymark @Ed_Miliband @David_Cameron whats the word for lambskin appron no not templar
@David_Cameron so allowing mass immigration isn't causing any security risks? Tell Lee Rigbys family that!!
@chunkymark @Ed_Miliband @David_Cameron Because it's not really him. He's too busy thinking up cunning plans to make us all suffer
@David_Cameron Whilst I agree with Trident renewal, you have unfortunately sunk to the same level as Lab & SNP on this subject.
@David_Cameron surely national security is no safer in a 21 century arms race? Did Trident prevent the Iraq war or destabilisation of Libya?
@David_Cameron - Dave? https://twitter.com/kevanjonesmp/status/586067335590600704 …
@David_Cameron @nick_clegg HERE IS ONE ON TRIDENT, WHAT WOULD THE EU, AND AMERICA THINK IF WE GOT RID OF THE DETERRENT?, SNP I QUESTION!!!
#CoALEition Ale is an @Official_MRLP brand (with partner brewers ) 'stolen' by @David_Cameron
Then why didn't you do a head to head debate with @Ed_Miliband rather than bleating about your views on here?? @David_Cameron
@David_Cameron Couldn't lie straight in bed stick to facts for once what a negative campaign the Tories are running
@David_Cameron apart from the @Conservatives cuts to the armed forces, police & fire service! you are a joke & I'm praying you lose GE2015!!
@David_Cameron we are at risk, our armed forces where cut. Navy ,RAF ,Army budgets reduced ,we where told we did not need them
@David_Cameron oh please...Let's put Trident 20 miles from where your kids go to school and then see if you're so happy to keep it! #VoteSNP
@David_Cameron Appeasement ? Remember what happened during the interbellum !!!
@Celestite66 @David_Cameron dirty nuke doomsday bomb deterrent put near symbolic Aldermaston MAD #whoarethepatriotsnow #endnomdomdomination
@David_Cameron @364690 What's trident got to do with national security? I'm more concerned with ur cuts 2armed forces instead of toys4 navy
@OllyFawcett @David_Cameron got your polling card in post?
@David_Cameron I don't want trident but while Russia has someone like Putin at the helm we need it. Sad but true. They don't deal in sense
@David_Cameron what weed are you smoking, what about austerity defence cuts, get off the skunk Dave.
@David_Cameron No they are not Lib Dems hardly in favour of Trident Desperate stuff from a desperate party EDM attack just woeful #vermin
@David_Cameron but they would do.. pic.twitter.com/dSJrwu3IuI

@David_Cameron our security is not at risk by not biilding trident it will not stop isis and co lets get real not a crosbie strong point
@David_Cameron @DMiliband @SkyNews what you mean like slashing troop numbers, scrapping carriers and using old aircraft so we 2nd rate force
@David_Cameron @Conservatives Love the posturing but...[coughs] will you commit to 2% beyond 2016? http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/02/us-army-chief-of-staff-concern-defence-budget …
@David_Cameron @Conservatives - says the bloke who is slashing the armed forces, the police, the fire service, the prison service #lyingtory
@David_Cameron nuclear weapons put the whole planet at risk
@David_Cameron you've already put our Security at Risk... Our Armed Forces are nothing more than a defence for! Not one to be scared of!
@David_Cameron - Personal attacks on Ed Miliband do not help advance the case for maintaining the Trident deterrent in an unstable world
@David_Cameron @England_First Really? Libya? Ill considered swingeing cuts? Mouthing off about the Ukraine?
@David_Cameron you're as dishonest as your party chair, no wonder you never sacked him. You'll do & say anything for power inc a SNP pact.
@David_Cameron Getting the 85% of adult autistics who want to work into work would be more worthwhile.
@David_Cameron Our security nxt 25yrs can't be guarded by #Trident PM. No one will fire nuclear weapons. We need a DIGITAL #PrimaryWeapon.
@David_Cameron U have done for 5 years falling to tackle the real issue at home, more people are killed daily on our streets, than trident
@Wirral_In_It @FraserNelson thought of @David_Cameron returning as PM fills me with dread. barely survived past 5 yrs of #Conservatives evil

@morrisseyobe On that we can agree Meg ,but @David_Cameron has not done his party any favours with savage military cuts
@David_Cameron @Conservatives but you have by scrapping Nimrod, cutting defence budget Trident doesn't defend our country it's a reprisal

@David_Cameron You already have with cuts to ,Navy, Army & Air force : No air power at sea ,Cuts in Front line Regiments , #Toryfail
@David_Cameron you can't even lie straight in bed
@David_Cameron No...A conservative government is too busy screwing the population to think about security. #conservativelies
